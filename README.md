# Node Chat App
This project is a dynamic Node.js application. It is built using Express Framework and Socket.io library. It uses the concepts of socket rooms. It accepts a unique username and room name as input from user. It demands for same room name for users to join under a same room. Users can share their location with other users in the room and send text messages. Sidenav displays all the active users in the room.I did this project in a Udemy free course.
